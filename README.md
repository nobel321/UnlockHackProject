# Description:
This is a simple math education tool that I created in the form of a terminal window for the Unlock Hack Hackathon. The key feature I wanted to hightlight in this project is the math visualization, via ascii art, aspect. As many people pose to be natural visual learners as humans learn, generally, by example, I strove to create a tool that would play to the abilities of young children to that they can acquire base understanding of important geometric concepts and many more things. I plan on adding many more graphic mathematics models in the future and eventually integrating a 3D interactive work space where child users can understand 3D geometry concepts such as volume and surface area.
